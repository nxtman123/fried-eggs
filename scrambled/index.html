            <p>

                Scrambled eggs can be made with a variety of ingredients
                additional to eggs, including:

            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>milk</li>
                    <li>butter</li>
                    <li>grated cheese</li>
                    <li>chives</li>
                    <li>herbs</li>
                    <li>ham</li>
                    <li>chopped vegitables</li>
                </ul>
            <p>

                The eggs are cracked into a bowl and the mixture is stirred or
                whisked. Alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot
                pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as
                they cook. The mixture can be poured into a hot pan containing
                melted butter or oil, where it starts coagulating. The heat
                is turned down and the eggs are stirred as they cook. This
                creates small, soft curds of egg. Unlike pancake or omelette
                scrambled egg is virtually never browned. A thin pan is
                preferable to prevent browning. With continuous stirring, and
                not allowing the eggs to stick to the pan, the eggs themselves
                will maintain the pan temperature at about the boiling point of
                water, until they coagulate.
