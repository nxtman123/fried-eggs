                Cooked on one side only, until the egg white is set, but the
                yolk remains liquid. This can be difficult to do without buring
                the bottom of the egg or leaving the top of the yolk uncooked.
                Cooking the top can be achived by gently splashing the hot
                cooking oil or fat over the sunny side uncooked white. Another
                technique is to cover the pan with a lid during cooking and
                adding a teaspoon of water.<br /><br />

                Sunny side up eggs are also commonly referred to as dippy eggs
                or dip eggs by Marylanders, by some in central Pennsylvania, in
                parts of Ohio, and in Pittsburgh mainly due to the practice of
                dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also
                occasionally used in Canada.
